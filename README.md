# Harvard Data Science Animation Contest Github Repository Template

This repo is meant to be a guide for your entire submission - how to format your code, name your files, and create your final submission. If you are new to Github, [follow this tutorial to get started](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

**Your repository should contain the following items:**
- [x] a file containing your code with the name "firstnamelastname_code" (e.g, ["harrypotter_code.R"](CodeExamples/harrypotter_code.R))
- [x] an artifact (animated GIF, html5 animation, etc) that your code produced (e.g, ["gganimate.gif"](ArtifactExamples/gganimate.gif))
- [x] a submission markdown file with the name "firstnamelastname_submission.md" (**[guide for formatting that submission here](SubmissionTemplate.md)**)

If you'd like, you can fork this repo as a starting point. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact WHOEVER@HARVARD.EDU.

Happy coding, and good luck!
