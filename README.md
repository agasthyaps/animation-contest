# Harvard Data Science Animation Contest Github Repo Template

This repo is meant to be a guide for your entire submission - how to format your code, name your files, and create your final submission. 

Your repository should contain the following items:
- a file containing your code with the name "firstnamelastname_code" (e.g, ["harrypotter_code.R"](harrypotter_code.R))
- an artifact (animated GIF, html5 animation, etc) that your code produced (e.g, ["gganimate.gif"](gganimate.gif))
- a submission markdown file with the name "firstnamelastname_submission.md" ([guide for formatting that submission here](SubmissionTemplate.md))

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact WHOEVER@HARVARD.EDU.

Happy coding, and good luck!
